Solo Developed - FPS SURVIVAL - SANDBOX VERSION RELEASED - CONTROLS ARE LISTED IN GAME

Hook - Dynamic Graph Node Chain Eliminates Enemies 

Summary - Neon aesthetic survival game with light from 5 different weapons used as energy to eliminate evolving enemies. Each increment of eliminations evolves the enemies, giving them abilities and stats that make it harder and harder to survive.

The enemy is a basic AI that runs at the player if it is in line of sight using a Navigation mesh.

Each of the 5 weapons has a different color, everytime you switch weapons, the environment changes and grants you different bonuses based on the weapon you have equipped.

There is a jetpack and hover system for verticality, they use health as their energy, so the longer they are used, the more health is lost. There is also an overheat system in place for the jetpack.

There are a lot of other details and features, but they are not all listed in this read me.
