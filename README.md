Solo Developed - FPS SURVIVAL

Hook - Dynamic Graph Node Chain Eliminates Enemies 

Summary - Neon aesthetic survival game with light from 5 different weapons used as energy to eliminate evolving enemies. Each increment of eliminations evolves the enemies, giving them abilities and stats that make it harder and harder to survive.

The enemy is a basic AI that runs at the player if it is in line of sight using a Navigation mesh.

There are three different classes to choose from - Each provides a unique trait, Archon can have lerping positional nodes, Shadow can have different light flow modes for the projectiles that hit nodes, and Bastion has healing and ressurection to avoid death.

Each of the 5 weapons has a different color, everytime you switch weapons, the environment changes and grants you different bonuses based on the weapon you have equipped.

There is a jetpack and hover system for verticality, they use health as their energy, so the longer they are used, the more health is lost. There is also an overheat system in place for the jetpack.

Time/Elimination Ratio determines the currency you recieve for each round of survival.

For now the only thing you can buy with currency are titles which give stat bonuses and achievements. More is planned for later.

Not yet implemented is level generation through portals in a mapping system. After you complete one map, you will travel to the next map, endlessly as they progressively get harder to complete. There will be enemy and map variation. 

There are a lot of other details and features, but they are not all listed in this read me.
